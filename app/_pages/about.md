The Critical Truth is a deeply personal project started and run by David Scott. A fan of all forms of culture, this website was built as a means of opening up a discussion and providing a platform for exploring truth in art. It is my firm belief that art does not happen in a vacuum and that you cannot create something without making a statement. What you'll find here is a mixture of thoughtful reviews that try to gauge the quality of a film above and beyond just how much the reviewer enjoyed it and editorials that ask important questions about the works they discuss.

By engaging with movies beyond the simple question of whether or not they were enjoyable, I hope to find more meaning in the media we consume because I believe it is important to think about what you take in and put back out. To contact us, request a review of a movie, show, book, or game, or especially if you are interested in contributing, please email us at [fearsometruth@gmail.com](mailto:fearsometruth@gmail.com).
