The Alien franchise is one of the longest running franchises in movie history. Not counting crossover movies with the Predator franchise, the Aliens univers spans 7 films (with an 8th slated for 2017) and 38 years since Ridley Scott first made the original.

While I want to speak about many of these films in great depth in future retrospectives, here I want to take a broader look at the franchise as a whole. With so many talented artists, writers, directors, and composers working independently across so many eras of cinema, few continuous franchises can give us as profound a look into changing tastes and styles. Where we started with Alien and where we are now after Prometheus are two very different places and I want to explore that.

Few franchises have such a strong start. Alien (1979) is one of the most lasting scifi horror films of all time, with some of the most deliberate pacing, progressive character development, thoughtful suspense, and terrifying monsters of all time. Xenomorphs, the primary extraterestrial antagonist in the Alien franchise, is the manifestation of an apex predator that survives through sexual predation that births itself by eating its victims from the inside out.

The evocative style of the xenomorphs, based on the work of H.R. Giger, haunt you on a subconscious level. They are organized in their chaos, and grotesque in their macabre physique. Simultaneously monstrous and admirable, grotesque and aesthetically engrossing, a series of paradoxical elements all come to life at once and working harmoniously with the narrative terrors they were meant to embody.

Opposing the xenomorphs is the Weyland-Yutani corporation. While we sometimes get a brief glimpse into them as a mega corporation creating everything from toys and clothes to moving vast intergalactic mining operations, they primarily serve as an invisible foil. A wall against which the aliens push the protagonists, undermining their survival from beyond reach in ways that can be subtle and sometimes aggressively overt.

Each new director to create a film in the franchise has managed to take this creature in fundamentally new directions and sculpt unique interpretations. All of these entries have preserved the sense of claustrophobia caused by the being caught between extraterestrial predators and the amorphous touch of corporate greed from afar. Even the debatably poor films in the franchise are arguably very entertaining.
