I want to start off by saying that the movie was pretty enjoyable while watching it, and I didn't regret my time in the theater. The action is fairly well paced as it flows from scene to scene. While there are a lot of plot holes in the internal logic and even in the time tables of the story, there's an emotional logic to it that will prevent it from bothering most people until they stop and think about it.

If you can turn off your brain and enjoy a dumb movie for two hours before tearing it apart, go watch it before you read anything else about it. It will do that for you. Ultimately there is more bad than good here, though, and you'll either forget this movie pretty fast or remember it more for what it does wrong than right.
